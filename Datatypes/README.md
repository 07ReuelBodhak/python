# **Data Types in python**

There are variety of data types in python

- **Numeric types**
- **Sequence types**
- **Set types**
- **Mapping types**
- **Boolean types**
- **Binary types**
- **None types**

## Numeric types:

1. **Int** : Integer type holds
2. **Float** : Float type holds
3. **Complex** : Complex Number holds

lets see what is complex number in deep:

For using and creating a variable of Complex Data Type in Python, we use the complex() method. This method can be used for converting a number or string into a complex Data Type in Python.

**Syntax of complex() in Python**

```
complex(real, imaginary)
```

- real: The first parameter of the complex() Function defines the real part of the complex number. It is an optional parameter and its default value is 0 is we donâ€™t specify it.

- imaginary: The second parameter defines the imaginary part of the complex number. It is also an optional Parameter and it takes a default value of 0 if we do not specify it.

summary :

In Python, a complex data type is used to represent complex numbers, which are numbers that have both a real and an imaginary part. A complex number is written as a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. The j is used to denote the imaginary unit.

## Sequence types

- str = String type is sequence of characters enclosed in ""
- list = Ordered, Mutable collection of items. Used for ordered data storage
- tuple = Ordered, Immutable collections of items. Used For fixed Collection
- range: Represent Sequence of numbers used For generating Sequences

## Mapping Types

- dic = Collections of key-value pairs, It is used for storing data with named attributes

## Set Types

- set = Unordered Collection of unique Items. Removing Duplicate Mathematical set operations
- frozenset = Immutable sets

## Boolean Types

- bool = boolean values used for True False Condition

## Binary Types

- bytes = Immutable Sequence of bytes. Used for binary data, network data transmission

- bytearray = Mutable sequence of bytes. Used for binary data that changes.

- memoryview = Memory view object. Used for memory efficient data access

## None Type

- None = Represent the absence of value . used to denote "no Value"
