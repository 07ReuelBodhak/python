# Working with Binary Data in python

- there are 8 bits in one bit
- bits wither consists of 0 or 1
- A byte can be interpreted in different way like binary, hexadecimal

### What are Hexadecimal, Octal and Binary

1. a hexadecimal number system is a type of number system that has base value equal to 16.

2. binary number simple means 0 and 1

3. the octal number system is the base-8 number system, and uses digits 0 to 7

# Number Systems Table

This table shows numbers from 0 to 16 in binary, octal, hexadecimal, and decimal systems.

| Decimal | Binary | Octal | Hexadecimal |
| ------- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 0       | 0000   | 0     | 0x0         |
| 1       | 0001   | 1     | 0x1         |
| 2       | 0010   | 2     | 0x2         |
| 3       | 0011   | 3     | 0x3         |
| 4       | 0100   | 4     | 0x4         |
| 5       | 0101   | 5     | 0x5         |
| 6       | 0110   | 6     | 0x6         |
| 7       | 0111   | 7     | 0x7         |
| 8       | 1000   | 10    | 0x8         |
| 9       | 1001   | 11    | 0x9         |
| 10      | 1010   | 12    | 0xA         |
| 11      | 1011   | 13    | 0xB         |
| 12      | 1100   | 14    | 0xC         |
| 13      | 1101   | 15    | 0xD         |
| 14      | 1110   | 16    | 0xE         |
| 15      | 1111   | 17    | 0xF         |

binary datatype are useful when dealing with files, network communication and any kind of data that isn't necessarily text.

1. bytes : immutable sequence of file useful for representing binary data, like image or file

2. bytearray : mutable sequence of bytes, useful when u need a modifiable array of bytes
